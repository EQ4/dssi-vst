dssi-vst: a DSSI plugin wrapper for VST plugins
===============================================

This is a ***CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE AND NON-WORKING*** implementation of
a DSSI plugin wrapper for VST effects and instruments with GUI support.

Source files:

* dssi-vst.cpp: DSSI plugin implementation (works OK mostly)
* dssi-vst_gui.cpp: DSSI plugin GUI process implementation (not done yet)
* dssi-vst-scanner.cpp: Program that determines what VSTs you have (a bit
  like fstconfig in the fst package) and communicates it back to the plugin
* dssi-vst-server.cpp: Program that hosts a single VST with a comms link
  to the plugin (a bit like a less general version of Kjetil's vstserver)
* rdwrops.cpp: misc functions
* remotepluginclient.cpp/remotepluginserver.cpp: Code to handle process
  separation for audio plugin (not VST specific), used by DSSI plugin & server
* vstsyth.cpp: JACK/aseq host for VSTs using dssi-vst-server (but not using
  the actual DSSI plugin).  Mostly for test purposes, this does nothing you
  can't already do better with vstserver or jack_fst.

Copyright (c) 2004 Chris Cannam.  dssi-vst does not use any code from
vstserver or libfst.  It requires recent Wine, liblo, and the VST SDK
headers to build.  Compilation and (especially) installation are
currently very involved, and no there isn't any documentation on it
yet.  There will be simplifications and docs later.

I strongly recommend not attempting to use this code at all at the moment.


Why not use vstserver or libfst?
--------------------------------

It doesn't use libfst because libfst is just too serious a thing to
start messing about with in a plugin whose host doesn't know about it
(because it involves introducing Wine threads into the host).

Architecturally dssi-vst is a bit like vstserver.  The main reason it
doesn't use vstserver is simply that I wrote most of this code quite a
while ago as an exercise, and I've just got used to my own code. 

FWIW most of the incomplete bits of this code are things that
vstserver wouldn't help with (particularly the separate GUI process).


Licence
-------

Basically GPL, but I guess we need an exception for the VST SDK
headers.  This code uses liblo, which is under the GPL without any
such exception, so I'm evidently going to have to think a bit harder
about this.  *sigh*  For now I advise against distributing it at all...
